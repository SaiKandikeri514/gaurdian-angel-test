# 🛡️ Guardian Angel - AI-Powered Security Code Review Agent

**Guardian Angel** is an intelligent AI agent that automates security code reviews for developers. Built using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, it leverages a multi-agent architecture to detect vulnerabilities and propose secure fixes in real-time.

---

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Automated Vulnerability Detection**: Scans code for security flaws including:
  - Hardcoded credentials
  - SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
  - SAP BTP-specific security issues (XSUAA, CAP, Cloud SDK)
  - And more...

- **🛡️ Secure Code Generation**: Automatically generates secure fixes with strict "Do No Harm" guardrails to preserve business logic

- **📊 Risk Scoring**: Provides a 0-100 risk score with detailed justification

- **🎨 Modern UI**: Interactive Streamlit dashboard with:
  - Visual vulnerability cards with severity indicators
  - Side-by-side code comparison
  - Detailed diff view
  - Accept/Reject workflow

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture**: Orchestrator-Worker pattern with specialized agents:
  - `SecurityOrchestrator`: Manages workflow
  - `VulnerabilityScanner`: Detects security issues
  - `SecureRefactorer`: Generates fixes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Google AI Studio API Key ([Get it here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sap-security-agent
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # source .venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     ```

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📖 Usage

1. **Paste Your Code**: Copy and paste your code snippet into the text area
2. **Click "Analyze & Fix"**: The agent will scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Review Results**: 
   - Check the risk score and vulnerability cards
   - View the proposed secure code fix
   - Compare the original vs. fixed code
4. **Accept or Reject**: Choose to apply or discard the fix
